# P2P-Client
Peer to peer client written in C

A P2P client works by created a connection over the internet directly from computer to computer (or peer to peer). The connection is done without the need for a central server as each connected device acts as both server and client to maintain the network. Once a connection is created, devices can send and recieve messages, run commands, and search directories.
